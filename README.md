# ASSET
ASynchronous Spidering Essential Tool (ASSET).

# Status

ASSET is currently in a PoC (Proof of Concept) stage. Feel free to toy around with it
and explore its potential, just take note that none of the API is documented or even
finalized.

# Todo

- [x] Add CLI interactions
- [ ] Add database relational model to store the crawled Pages
- [ ] Add RESTful API to provide data from said database
- [ ] Create better looking (and maybe interactive) graphs
- [ ] Don't recheck the same URL with different protocol
